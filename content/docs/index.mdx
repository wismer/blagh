I love dungeons and dragons. It's a fun, inventive game with simple enough mechanics. But no matter how 
much time I spend in planning adventures or playing them with my friends, I frequently forget
what abilities are responsible for what scenarios, what the modifier would be, etc. Looking it up can interrupt the flow
of the game. So what other ways can this information be displayed?

## Periodic Table

Back in high school I was not terribly interested in Chemistry, but the periodic table 
was a graphic where it gave me the first understanding of a design that was both appealing (a clear grid of elements)
and informative (each level representing # of electrons/atomic weight, etc).

<div className="periodic-example">

<div className="dnd-card element">
    <div className="atomic-number">1</div>
    <h3>H</h3>
    <div>Helium</div>
    <span>1.0</span>
</div>
</div>

D&D abilities are not atomic elements, so less information is needed. Just name, abbreviation, score and modifier.
