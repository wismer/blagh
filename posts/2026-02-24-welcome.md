# Welcome

This is my personal blog, hosted on my own infrastructure at `gremlin.computer`.

## Why Self-Host?

I wanted a place to write that I fully control. No platform algorithms, no ads, no data mining. Just words and thoughts.

## What to Expect

Random musings on:
- Technology and programming
- Self-hosting adventures
- Whatever else seems interesting

## Technical Setup

This blog runs on:
- Flask backend
- PostgreSQL database
- Markdown files with Jekyll-style front matter
- Deployed on a Raspberry Pi

Simple, fast, and completely under my control.
